# Open Data Curriculum Service  

This is a tool for displaying parsed data from the public open data from [opendata.skolverket.se](http://opendata.skolverket.se/)

The actual parser is located in this [github project](https://github.com/stefan-jonasson/curriculum-parser) 

The service both contains HTML views for the data as well as an API for delivering it in JSON format.
The api is reachable from the following urls: 
- `<host>/api/subject/{subjectName}` - Json structure for the subject level content
- `<host>/api//subject/{subjectName}/courses`- Json structure for all the courses
- `<host>/api//subject/{subjectName}/course/{courseCode}`- Json structure for a specific course
